When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n *\n * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n * In naive implementations it\u0027s possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n *\n * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n * snapshot id. To get the total supply at the time of a snapshot, call the function {totalSupplyAt} with the snapshot\n * id. To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n * and the account address.\n *\n * NOTE: Snapshot policy can be customized by overriding the {_getCurrentSnapshotId} method. For example, having it\n * return `block.number` will trigger the creation of snapshot at the beginning of each new block. When overriding this\n * function, be careful about the monotonicity of its result. Non-monotonic snapshot ids will break the contract.\n *\n * Implementing snapshots for every block using this method will incur significant gas costs. For a gas-efficient\n * alternative consider {ERC20Votes}.\n *\n * ==== Gas Costs\n *\n * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n *\n * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping. This overhead is\n * only significant for the first transfer that immediately follows a snapshot for a particular account. Subsequent\n * transfers will have normal cost until the next snapshot, and so on.\n */\n\nabstract contract ERC20Snapshot is ERC20 {\n    // Inspired by Jordi Baylina\u0027s MiniMeToken to record historical balances:\n    // https://github.com/Giveth/minime/blob/ea04d950eea153a04c51fa510b068b9dded390cb/contracts/MiniMeToken.sol\n\n    using Arrays for uint256[];\n    using Counters for Counters.Counter;\n\n    // Snapshotted values have arrays of ids and the value corresponding to that id.
