This behavior is nonetheless conventional\n * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.\n *\n * Additionally, an `Approval` event is emitted on calls to `transferFrom`.\n * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just\n * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit\n * these events, as it isn\u0027t required by the specification.\n *\n * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`\n * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting\n * allowances.
