/**
    Pushin 🅿️ - The self-distibuting Binance token that pushes your 🅿️.
    
    Until now, digital assets like Bitcoin have required participation in mining or staking
    in order to receive a portion of the inflating supply. As a 🅿️ pusher, you as the holder 
    can partake in this inflation and watch your 🅿️ push itself, and that's on 🅿️.

    Total Supply: 100,000,000 🅿 (100 Million)

    Features of 🅿️:
    - 5% fee added back into liquidity and pushin holders 🅿️
    - Non-dilutive transactionless inflation, automatically increasing the balance of each
      holder daily without the need for a single transaction.
    - This method of inflation allows for the token to be applied to modern DeFi use cases
      without diluting the token holders, and that's on 🅿️.

    The token that pushes your 🅿️, let's start pushin!
