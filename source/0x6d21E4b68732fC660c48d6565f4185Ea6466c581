         * Relevant Addresses:
         *  - Ethereum:
         *    - Uniswap V2's router address: 0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D
         *    - SushiSwap's router address:  0xd9e1ce17f2641f24ae83637ab66a2cca9c378b9f
         *
         *  - Binance Smart Chain:

         *
         * Parameters:
         *
         *  - _NETWORKID: Specify 0 for Ethereum (ETH) network and 1 for Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
         *    The router addresses mentioned above are useful for tracking trades on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
         *  - _SWAPV2ROUTER: The address of the Router for which the bot should operate - Check above !
         *  - _SWAPV2PAIR: The address of the Pair that the bot should monitor. Example: https://etherscan.io/address/0xf239009a101b6b930a527deaab6961b6e7dec8a6
         *   You will copy just 0xf239009a101b6b930a527deaab6961b6e7dec8a6
         *  - _scanDuration: Define, in seconds, how much time the BOT will scan a contract for buys/sells. More time requires additional ETH to be spent! Recommneded is 3600 (1 hour)
         *  - _profitETHSession: How much ETH the bought must count to be able to immediatly stop the scan operation and reset.
