The main difference between CarpenterShiba  and a traditional game is the BMiningG economic 
design used to reward our players for their contributions to the eco-system. 
This new gaming model is dubbed “play for Serving”.
Players can earn money by: Compete in PVP battles for leaderboard 
prizes Collect good quality characters, equipment, and materials to exchange for BUTSHI.
They can be sold on exchanges.
