HYPER DEFLATIONARY TOKEN WITH 5% of $PEPE REFLECTIONS!
$wojakRush  is a deflationary token designed to become scarce over time. All holders of $wojakRush , earn 5% in $PEPE rewards from live transactions (Buy,Sell, Send) Strategic buyback, 3% tokens are collected from every transaction and converted to BNB, and are stored in Our contract. When BuyBack function Is called, it will purchase $pepe directly from exchanges and instantly burns the tokens from circulating supply while pushing the price floor. 2% of every transaction is transferred into the liquidity pool for Pancakeswap to create a stable price floor. 1% of every transaction is sent to marketing/development wallet to ensure we have constant flow of funds for marketing and development.
