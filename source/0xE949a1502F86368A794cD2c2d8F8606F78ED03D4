    * For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
    *
    * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
    * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
    * to implement supply mechanisms].
    *
    * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
    * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
    * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
    *
    * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
    * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
    * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
    * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
    *
    * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
    * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
    * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
