 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

/**
  *
  * @title TransactionManager
  * @author Connext <support@connext.network>
  * @notice This contract holds the logic to facilitate crosschain transactions.
  *         Transactions go through three phases in the happy case:
  *
  *         1. Route Auction (offchain): User broadcasts to our network 
  *         signalling their desired route. Routers respond with sealed bids 
  *         containing commitments to fulfilling the transaction within a 
  *         certain time and price range.
  *
  *         2. Prepare: Once the auction is completed, the transaction can be 
  *         prepared. The user submits a transaction to `TransactionManager` 
  *         contract on sender-side chain containing router's signed bid. This 
  *         transaction locks up the users funds on the sending chain. Upon 
  *         detecting an event containing their signed bid from the chain, 
  *         router submits the same transaction to `TransactionManager` on the 
  *         receiver-side chain, and locks up a corresponding amount of 
  *         liquidity. The amount locked on the receiving chain is `sending 
  *         amount - auction fee` so the router is incentivized to complete the 
  *         transaction.
  *
  *         3. Fulfill: Upon detecting the `TransactionPrepared` event on the 
  *         receiver-side chain, the user signs a message and sends it to a 
  *         relayer, who will earn a fee for submission. The relayer (which may 
  *         be the router) then submits the message to the `TransactionManager` 
  *         to complete their transaction on receiver-side chain and claim the 
  *         funds locked by the router. A relayer is used here to allow users 
  *         to submit transactions with arbitrary calldata on the receiving 
  *         chain without needing gas to do so. The router then submits the 
  *         same signed message and completes transaction on sender-side, 
  *         unlocking the original `amount`.
  *
  *         If a transaction is not fulfilled within a fixed timeout, it 
  *         reverts and can be reclaimed by the party that called `prepare` on 
  *         each chain (initiator). Additionally, transactions can be cancelled 
  *         unilaterally by the person owed funds on that chain (router for 
  *         sending chain, user for receiving chain) prior to expiry.
