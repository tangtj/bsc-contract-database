/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since a proxied contract can't have a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() initializer {}

 * @title Alethea Character Economies ERC20 Token
 *
 * @notice Character token is the utility token of the Alethea AI Character Economies Protocol.
 *      It serves as character economy currency
 *      Character token powers up the character governance protocol (Character DAO)
 *
 * @notice Token Summary:
 *      - Symbol: <defined on creation>
 *      - Name: <defined on creation>
 *      - Decimals: 18
 *      - Initial/maximum total supply: 10,000,000 Character tokens
 *      - Initial supply holder (initial holder) address: <defined on creation>
 *      - Mintability: configurable (initially enabled, but possible to revoke forever)
 *      - Burnability: configurable (initially enabled, but possible to revoke forever)
 *      - DAO Support: supports voting delegation
 *
 * @notice Features Summary:
 *      - Supports atomic allowance modification, resolves well-known ERC20 issue with approve (arXiv:1907.00903)
 *      - Voting delegation and delegation on behalf via EIP-712 (like in Compound CMP token) - gives the token
 *        powerful governance capabilities by allowing holders to form voting groups by electing delegates
 *      - Unlimited approval feature (like in 0x ZRX token) - saves gas for transfers on behalf
 *        by eliminating the need to update “unlimited” allowance value
 *      - ERC-1363 Payable Token - ERC721-like callback execution mechanism for transfers,
 *        transfers on behalf and approvals; allows creation of smart contracts capable of executing callbacks
 *        in response to transfer or approval in a single transaction
 *      - EIP-2612: permit - 712-signed approvals - improves user experience by allowing to use a token
 *        without having an ETH to pay gas fees
 *      - EIP-3009: Transfer With Authorization - improves user experience by allowing to use a token
 *        without having an ETH to pay gas fees
 *
 * @dev Even though smart contract has mint() function which is used to mint initial token supply,
 *      the function is disabled forever after smart contract deployment by revoking `TOKEN_CREATOR`
 *      permission from the deployer account
 *
 * @dev Token balances and total supply are effectively 192 bits long, meaning that maximum
 *      possible total supply smart contract is able to track is 2^192 (close to 10^40 tokens)
 *
 * @dev Smart contract doesn't use safe math. All arithmetic operations are overflow/underflow safe.
 *      Additionally, Solidity 0.8.7 enforces overflow/underflow safety.
 *
 * @dev Multiple Withdrawal Attack on ERC20 Tokens (arXiv:1907.00903) - resolved

 * @dev Compound-like voting delegation functions', public getters', and events' names
 *      were changed for better code readability (Alethea Name <- Comp/Zeppelin name):
 *      - votingDelegates           <- delegates
 *      - votingPowerHistory        <- checkpoints
 *      - votingPowerHistoryLength  <- numCheckpoints
 *      - totalSupplyHistory        <- _totalSupplyCheckpoints (private)
 *      - usedNonces                <- nonces (note: nonces are random instead of sequential)
 *      - DelegateChanged (unchanged)
 *      - VotingPowerChanged        <- DelegateVotesChanged
 *      - votingPowerOf             <- getCurrentVotes
 *      - votingPowerAt             <- getPriorVotes
 *      - totalSupplyAt             <- getPriorTotalSupply
 *      - delegate (unchanged)
 *      - delegateWithAuthorization <- delegateBySig
 * @dev Compound-like voting delegation improved to allow the use of random nonces like in EIP-3009,
 *      instead of sequential; same `usedNonces` EIP-3009 mapping is used to track nonces

/**
 * @title Access Control List
 *
 * @notice Access control smart contract provides an API to check
 *      if specific operation is permitted globally and/or
 *      if particular user has a permission to execute it.
 *
 * @notice It deals with two main entities: features and roles.
 *
 * @notice Features are designed to be used to enable/disable specific
 *      functions (public functions) of the smart contract for everyone.
 * @notice User roles are designed to restrict access to specific
 *      functions (restricted functions) of the smart contract to some users.
 *
 * @notice Terms "role", "permissions" and "set of permissions" have equal meaning
 *      in the documentation text and may be used interchangeably.
 * @notice Terms "permission", "single permission" implies only one permission bit set.
 *
 * @notice Access manager is a special role which allows to grant/revoke other roles.
 *      Access managers can only grant/revoke permissions which they have themselves.
 *      As an example, access manager with no other roles set can only grant/revoke its own
 *      access manager permission and nothing else.
 *
 * @notice Access manager permission should be treated carefully, as a super admin permission:
 *      Access manager with even no other permission can interfere with another account by
 *      granting own access manager permission to it and effectively creating more powerful
 *      permission set than its own.
 *
 * @dev Both current and OpenZeppelin AccessControl implementations feature a similar API
 *      to check/know "who is allowed to do this thing".
 * @dev Zeppelin implementation is more flexible:
 *      - it allows setting unlimited number of roles, while current is limited to 256 different roles
 *      - it allows setting an admin for each role, while current allows having only one global admin
 * @dev Current implementation is more lightweight:
 *      - it uses only 1 bit per role, while Zeppelin uses 256 bits
 *      - it allows setting up to 256 roles at once, in a single transaction, while Zeppelin allows
 *        setting only one role in a single transaction
 *
 * @dev This smart contract is designed to be inherited by other
 *      smart contracts which require access control management capabilities.
 *
 * @dev Access manager permission has a bit 255 set.
 *      This bit must not be used by inheriting contracts for any other permissions/features.
