     * Furthermore, `isContract` will also return true if the target contract within
     * the same transaction is already scheduled for destruction by `SELFDESTRUCT`,
     * which only has an effect at the end of a transaction.

     * Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged. It breaks composability, breaks support for smart wallets
